1. Project Overview

This solution aims to provide a cloud-native student fee management system leveraging various Azure services. The system is designed to automate fee notifications, provide a secure API for managing and querying fee details, and allow role-based access for students and administrators. The project is built on Azureâ€™s serverless computing, data storage, and automation features.

2. Solution Architecture

Azure SQL Database: Stores structured fee records for students and administrators.
Azure Functions: Serves as the backend to calculate fees, provide API endpoints, and handle other serverless computing requirements.
Azure Logic Apps: Automates fee reminders and other notifications for students.
Azure API Management: Securely exposes the fee-related APIs to students and administrators.
Azure AD Authentication & RBAC: Manages role-based access control for administrators.
Azure Application Insights: Monitors the entire solution and provides insights into performance and failures.

4. Step-by-Step Deployment Guide
Create Azure SQL Database:

Set up an Azure SQL Database through the Azure Portal.
Deploy the provided Students and Administrators tables.
Populate the database with sample data for testing.
Deploy Azure Functions:

Create an Azure Functions App.
Implement the required logic to fetch fee details and return the payment status.
Secure the API with API Management.
Configure Azure Logic Apps:

Set up a Logic App to automate the fee reminder emails.
Use the SendGrid or Outlook connector for sending emails.
Set up Azure API Management:

Create an API Management service.
Import the Azure Functions to expose them securely via API.
Set rate limits and configure authentication using API keys.
Configure Azure AD and RBAC:

Set up Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for authentication.
Configure RBAC to restrict the update fee endpoint to administrators only.
Monitor and Scale:

Set up Application Insights for monitoring.
Implement scaling policies for Azure Functions and Logic Apps to handle up to 5000 students.

5. Demo Requirements
API Functionality:

Demonstrate the API that allows students to check their fee status.
Showcase the payment status as "Paid", "Partially Paid", or "Overdue."
Fee Reminders:

Show automated email reminders sent to students for overdue payments.
Secure Admin Functions:

Demonstrate an administrator updating student fee records.
Show how RBAC ensures only authorized users can perform this operation.

6. Code and Scripts
Azure SQL Setup:
SQL Scripts for database creation and data population.
Azure Function Code:
C# Code to implement the fee status retrieval and update functionality.
Logic App Flow:
Logic App JSON to automate fee reminders.
API Management Configuration:
Policy Configuration for rate limiting and authentication.

8. Conclusion
The Fee Management System designed using Azure services is highly scalable, secure, and automated. With this solution, students can easily check their fee status, administrators can manage fee records securely, and reminders are sent automatically to ensure timely payments. This architecture ensures the system can scale to meet the needs of a large student base while providing a seamless experience for all user
